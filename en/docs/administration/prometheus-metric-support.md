# Prometheus Metrics Support

The WSO2 API Platform for Kubernetes, integrated with Prometheus, enhances Kubernetes monitoring by providing monitoring and management capabilities for all APK components, leveraging real-time performance metrics. This enhanced observability empowers users to identify and address issues for smoother operations.

## Configure Prometheus Metrics

To enable metrics, simply make the metrics.enabled field true under the helm-charts/values.yaml file as shown.

```
metrics:
  enabled: true
```

All configurations related to metrics are as follows. The use of each configuration is described in the table below.
```
metrics:
  enabled: true   
  configDSBalHost: 0.0.0.0
  idpDSBalHost: 0.0.0.0
  statsd:
    image:
      repository: prom/statsd-exporter
       tag: v0.26.0
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    resources:
       limits:
          memory: 128Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 0.1
           memory: 64Mi
```

| statsd             | Statsd is an exporter used to expose the metrics of the ratelimiter service. Statsd will run as a sidecar to the ratelimiter if metrics are enabled and the statsd section has been uncommented                            |
| statsd.image.repository             | Specifies the Docker image repository for the statsd-exporter.                             |
| statsd.image.tag            | Specifies the Docker image version for the statsd-exporter.                             |
| imagePullPolicy            | Defines the policy for pulling the statsd Docker image.                           |
| statsd.resources.limits.memory      | The maximum amount of memory the container can use.                          |
| statsd.resources.requests.cpu      | The minimum amount of CPU the container is guaranteed.                         |
| statsd.resources.requests.memory      |The minimum amount of memory the container is guaranteed.                          |

## Configuring Prometheus Server

1. Incorporate configurations similar to the following in your prometheus.yml file. Based on your method of deploying Prometheus, the following can be added as a ConfigMap.
```
prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'prometheus'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9090']
      - job_name: 'adapter'
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
          - role: pod
            namespaces: # if you wish to filter your components by namespace as well
              names:
                - 'apk'
        relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
            regex: '.*adapter.*' # name of the component    
            action: keep
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number]
            regex: '18006' # Replace with the appropriate port number
            action: keep
          - target_label: __metrics_path__
            replacement: /metrics   # the metrics path.
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_id, __meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_number]
            replacement: '$1/$2'
            target_label: instance
```
Similar configurations should be added for all of the components you wish to expose metrics for. Configurations for each component have been tabulated below.

| Component                 | Component Name    | Exposed Port(s)   | Metrics Path      |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Router                    | router            |9000               |/stats/prometheus  |
| Ratelimiter               | ratelimiter       |9102               |/metrics           |
| Adapter                   | adapter           |18006              |/metrics           |
| Enforcer                  | enforcer          |18006              |/metrics           |
| Common Controller         | common-controller |18006              |/metrics           |
| Config Deployer Service** | config-ds         |18006 and 18007    |/metrics           |
| IDP Domain Service**      | idpds             |18006 and 18007    |/metrics           |


** Note that the Config Deployer Service and IDP Domain Service both have two ports exposed for both Ballerina and JVM metrics.

!!! Note
    Configure the prometheus service with the required level of permissions on Kubernetes.

## Using APK Grafana Dashboards

* Download the dashboard json files from [WSO2 APK Grafana Dashboards](../assets/img/prometheus/grafana-dashboards/APK%20Grafana%20Dashboards.zip)
